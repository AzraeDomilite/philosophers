# Timing Management Documentation

## Overview
The philosophers program uses precise timing mechanisms to manage eating, sleeping, and thinking cycles, as well as death detection.

## Key Timing Functions

### get_time
```c
time_t get_time(void)
```
Returns current time in milliseconds since epoch. Used for:
- Tracking meal times
- Monitoring death conditions
- Managing action durations

### start_delay
```c
void start_delay(time_t start_time)
```
Manages synchronized start of philosophers:
- Ensures all threads begin simultaneously
- Prevents race conditions at startup
- Creates staggered start pattern for odd/even philosophers

### philo_sleep
```c
void philo_sleep(t_data *data, time_t sleep_time)
```
Implements precise sleeping mechanism:
- Uses microsleep for accuracy
- Checks simulation status during sleep
- Prevents oversleeping

## Timing Considerations

### Critical Timings
1. **Death Detection**
   - Checked every millisecond
   - Based on time since last meal
   - Must be extremely precise

2. **Action Durations**
   - Eating: Exact time specified by arguments
   - Sleeping: Exact time specified by arguments
   - Thinking: Calculated based on remaining time before death

### Synchronization
- Even-numbered philosophers start with thinking
- Odd-numbered philosophers start with eating
- Prevents immediate deadlocks
- Optimizes fork usage
